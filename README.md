- 👋 Hi, I’m @epistropheus27
- 👀 I’m interested in plant secondary metabolites and generally plant stress mechanisms. It is just a plus that I have also found use of programming and
the many benefits programming provides. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced statistics in R and mostly different Python libraries and concepts in bioinformatics/genomics.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on establishing a multi-omic dynamic database for plant secondary metabolites.
